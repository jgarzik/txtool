Build bitcoin transactions
--------------------------
Usage: txtool [options] COMMAND [command parameters]

Options:
  -f, --file  Load/store transaction state to/from FILE


Theory of operation
-------------------
All operation revolves around an internal database, which is modified
via execution of a command operation:
	1. txtool reads transaction state file (JSON). Default "txstatedb.json".
	2. txtool executes command given on command line,
	   updating transaction state.
	3. txtool writes transaction state file, overwriting
	   previous version.

"transaction state" is anything involving the given transaction being
built, examined or modified.

A session begins when a new database is initialized, using the "init"
command.


txtool command summary
----------------------

dump
	Inspect transaction state database.

help
	List this command summary.

init
	Initialize new transaction state database.

inputs TXID1 VOUT1 TXID2 VOUT2...
	Raw transaction building.  Append to list of TX inputs.

inputs.clear
	Clear list of TX inputs.

multisig N-REQUIRED KEY1 KEY2 KEY3...
	Begin new multi-sig tx

nreq N-REQUIRED
	Specify number of sigs required for a multisig tx

outputs ADDRESS1 VALUE1 ADDRESS2 VALUE2...
	Raw transaction building.  Append to list of TX outputs.

outputs.clear
	Clear list of TX outputs.

pubkey.get ADDRESS

	RPC: Obtain full pubkey, given bitcoin address (pubkey hash),
	from bitcoind wallet.

pubkeys KEY1 KEY2 KEY3...
	Append to list of pubkeys / bitcoin addresses

pubkeys.clear
	Clear list of pubkeys.

raw SERIALIZED-TX
	Input serialized transaction from command line

raw.append FILE
	Append FILE to in-memory serialized transaction data.

raw.clear
	Clear serialized tx data.

raw.create
	RPC: create raw transaction, given inputs and outputs.

raw.decode
	RPC: decode raw transaction to readable JSON object.

raw.get TXID
	RPC: get raw transaction, given hash txid.

raw.read FILE
	Input serialized transaction from file.

raw.write FILE
	Output serialized transaction to file.

raw.sign [anyonecanpay]
	RPC: sign raw transaction, if possible.
	Uses keys in bitcoind's wallet.

	If the optional argument "anyonecanpay" is supplied,
	outputs are locked, but third party inputs may change.

raw.send
	RPC: broadcast raw transaction to network,
	returning a transaction id.

wallet.msig
	Commit in-memory multisig data (N-Required, Keys) to RPC wallet,
	returning a multisig payment address.


Encryption (walletpassphrase) note

The user is expected to authenticate with bitcoind RPC prior to using
this tool, if this tool will require access to private keys for the
operation (e.g. signing).
