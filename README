Build bitcoin transactions
--------------------------
Usage: txtool [options] COMMAND [command parameters]

Options:
  -f, --file  Load/store transaction state to/from FILE  [required]


Theory of operation
-------------------
All operation revolves around an internal database, which is modified
via execution of a command operation:
	1. txtool reads transaction state file (JSON).
	2. txtool executes command given on command line,
	   updating transaction state.
	3. txtool writes transaction state file, overwriting
	   previous version.

"transaction state" is anything involving the given transaction being
built, examined or modified.

A session begins when a new database is initialized, using the "init"
command.

Encryption (walletpassphrase) note
----------------------------------
The user is expected to authenticate with bitcoind RPC prior to using
this tool, if this tool will require access to private keys for the
operation (e.g. signing).
